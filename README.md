# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a simple Sudoku solver using backtracking in C. The solver reads a Sudoku puzzle, solves it, and prints the solution along with the total steps taken to find the solution.

## Features

- Solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- Displays the solved Sudoku grid.
- Shows the total number of steps taken to solve the puzzle.
- Uses a simple text-based user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/clubgamma/Sudoku.git
   cd Sudoku

2. Compile the code using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c sudoku.c -o sudoku_solver

## Usage
To run the Sudoku solver:
   ```bash
   ./sudoku_solver
  ```


The program initializes a pre-defined Sudoku puzzle and attempts to solve it. Modify the board array in main.c to test different puzzles.

## File Structure
   ```bash
   Sudoku/
   â”œâ”€â”€ main.c       # Entry point of the Sudoku solver
   â”œâ”€â”€ sudoku.h     # Header file containing structure and function declarations
   â””â”€â”€ sudoku.c     # Implementation of Sudoku solving logic
  ```

## Description of Files
- **main.c:** Contains the main function and initializes the Sudoku puzzle.
- **sudoku.h:** Defines the Sudoku structure and declares functions used in the solver.
- **sudoku.c:** Implements the logic for checking valid moves, solving the Sudoku, and printing the grid.

## How It Works
- The program initializes a Sudoku board with predefined values.
- It attempts to find an empty cell in the board.
- For each empty cell, it tries placing numbers from 1 to 9.
- If placing a number does not violate Sudoku rules, the program makes a recursive call to solve the rest of the board.
- If a valid solution is found, it prints the completed board and the total steps taken.
- If no solution exists, it informs the user.

## Avoiding Conflicts {Syncing Your Fork}

To keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository and avoid conflicts:

1. **Add Upstream Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/Sudoku.git
   ```

2. **Verify the New Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Sync Your Fork with Upstream:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   This will pull in changes from the parent repository and help you resolve any conflicts.

4. **Keep Updated:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your fork updated.
